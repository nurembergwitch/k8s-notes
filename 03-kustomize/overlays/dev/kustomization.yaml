  - replicas.yaml # copied the header of the base yaml + only added what's to be changed

# configMapGenerator will be automatically attached. Instead of using the one from base dir, the config map from the current dir will be used
configMapGenerator:
- name: mykustom-map
  env: config.properties



## according to the docs, configMapGenerator can also accept several files:
# configMapGenerator:
# - name: example-configmap-1
#   files:
#   - application.properties
#   - something.else


# this shit can take several env files - just change env to envs and make it a list
# configMapGenerator:
# - name: cmg-envs
#   envs:
#   - .env
#   - other.env

# configMapGenerator accepts literal key=value pairs:
# configMapGenerator:
# - name: cgm-literal
#   literals:
#   - FOO=Bar
#   - BAR=Baz
